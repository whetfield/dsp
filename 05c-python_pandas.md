# Python:  Introduction to Pandas    

This section should also be completed on HackerRank. The information below will help give you a surface level introduction to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). A widely used Data Science library in Python.

## Introduction
### What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.   

Pandas provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

### Pandas - the name
The name is derived from the term "Panel data", an econometric term for multidimensional structured data sets.  

### What is a Pandas data frame?  
**DataFrame** is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. It is generally the most commonly used pandas object.
